# AI Based Reporting App

This mini project demonstrates how to build an AI-based reporting application that enables users to generate flexible, criteria-driven reports. Users can simply type their reporting criteria, and the app—powered by an LLM (Anthropic) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers—automatically generates analytical results and visualizations. The system integrates two MCP servers: a Postgres MCP server for querying data sources, and a custom MCP server for creating visualizations. This architecture allows for dynamic, user-driven reporting and insightful data analysis with minimal manual setup.
